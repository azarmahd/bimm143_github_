In today's class we will examine some data about candy from the 538 website.

## Import Data

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

## Data Exploration

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruit)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

My favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, with a winpercent of 84.18029%.

```{r}
candy["Reese's Peanut Butter cup", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

```{r}
library("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```
The winpercent column is off scale compared to the other data. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

```{r}
candy$chocolate
```

The 0 and 1 are like a TRUE and FALSE, indicating whether the candy consists of chocolate or not. 

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=10)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=7)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, there is a slight right-skew to the nature of the histogram. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

The center of distribution for winpercent is right above 50%, but visually, it appears as though it is below 50%. 

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
chocolate.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
chocolate.win <- candy[chocolate.inds,]$winpercent
mean(chocolate.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.win <- candy[fruity.inds,]$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruity.win)
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("darkgreen", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
my_cols
```

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

```{r}
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height=10)
```

![Exported image that is a bit bigger so I can read it](mybarplot.png)

```{r}
my_cols=rep("darkgreen", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
my_cols
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_label(col=my_cols)
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text(col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 5, size = 3.3)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's miniature is one option.

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip, Ring Pop, Nestle's Smarties, Pop Rocks, Mounds. Nik L Nip is the least popular. 

## Exploring the Correlation Structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Fruity and chocolate have a very strong anti-correlation

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent are most positively correlated.

## 6. PCA

We will perform PCA of the candy. Do we need to scale the data before PCA?

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

ggplot version:

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
my_data
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(my_data)) + 
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
pca$rotation[,1]
```

```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(res) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(row.names(res), PC1)) +
geom_col()

```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus are all picked up strongly in the positive direction. This is correct because fruity candies are usually hard and come in variety. 

```{r}

```
