## What is in the PDB Database?

The main repository of biomolecular structure info is the PDB < www.rcsb.org >. 

Lets see what this database contains:

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

We have to get rid of the commas. Which function can do so?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
```

I can turn this into a function and then use `apply()` to work on the entire table of data.

```{r}
sumcomma <- function(x) {
  sum( as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)) )
}

sumcomma(stats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
n.total <- sumcomma(stats$Total)
n.total
```

```{r}
sumcomma(stats$EM)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma)
```

```{r}
apply(stats, 2, sumcomma) / sumcomma(stats$Total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}

```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

```{r}
186898/248805733 * 100
```


## Visualizing the HIV-1 Protease Structure

Mol* ("Mol-Star") viewer is now everywhere. 

I want to insert my image from Mol* here.

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can do bioinformatics predictions of functional motions (ie. flexibility/dynamics).

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis 

Here we will work through a complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family, starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper undersranding of structure, dynamics, and function. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"

aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```
